This file contains any messages produced by compilers while
running configure, to aid debugging if configure makes a mistake.

It was created by Rheia Framework configure 2.0.0, which was
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.65.  Invocation command line was

  $ ./configure --enable-wx29 --without-irrlicht --without-plplot --prefix=/usr/bin
